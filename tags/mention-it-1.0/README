Mention-It README / Install
===========================

Mention-It is a Javascript library that is built on the following:
  * jQuery - http://jquery.com/
  * Google AJAX Feed API - http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/ 
  
  
Installing Mention-It is as simple as including three Javascript tags:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="mention-it.js"></script>

The first two <script> tags load in the pre-requisites (Google AJAX Feed API and
jQuery, repectively).  The last <script> tag is "Mention-It"

Once you've added those three javascript files, you add a single <div> tag with
the @id='mention-it' to enable "Mention-It" on a given webpage.  Whatever text you
put in the @title of the <div> is what "Mention-It" will search.

For example, adding the following tag will cause "Mention-It" to search for mentions of
"open source" from around the web:

<div id='mention-it' title="'open source'"/>

Another example: Adding the following tag will cause "Mention-it" to search for mentions
(i.e. links to) a given URL/URI (in this case http://bibapp.org):

<div id='mention-it' title="'http://bibapp.org'"/>

That's all there is to it!  If you like "mention-it", be sure to mention it out on the web!
