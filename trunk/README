Release Notes
===============

[version 1.5] 
  * Fixed a few bugs, is now properly URL escaping all searches. 
  * Mention-It can now support boolean "OR" searches for all major services 
    (Twitter, FriendFeed, Google Blog Search) -- see Usage Examples below. 
  * Added License info to top of all files.  
  * Removed config for Technorati (no longer works, as they changed RSS 
    search feeds to require signup), and replaced with config for Ask Blog 
    Search

[version 1.0] 
  * Initial Version of Mention-It Javascript Library

=========================== 
Mention-It README / Install
===========================

Mention-It is a Javascript library that is built on the following: 
* jQuery - http://jquery.com/ 
* Google AJAX Feed API - http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/


Installing Mention-It is as simple as including three Javascript tags:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="mention-it.js"></script>

The first two <script> tags load in the pre-requisites (Google AJAX Feed API 
and jQuery, repectively).  The last <script> tag is "Mention-It"

Once you've added those three javascript files, you add a single <div> tag 
with the @id='mention-it' to enable "Mention-It" on a given webpage.  
Whatever text you put in the @title of the <div> is what "Mention-It" will 
search.

Mention-It generates a <div> of the following general structure 
(You can use CSS to stylize this <div> however you want!)
   
   <div id="mention-it">
     <div class="mentions-header">Recent mentions via...</div>
     <div class="mentions">
        <div class="mention-post">single mention goes here</div>
        ...
     </div>
     ...
   </div>  
   
See 'example.css' for more on <div> structure and sample CSS styling.

==============
Usage Examples
==============

For example, adding the following tag will cause "Mention-It" to search for
mentions of "open source" (as a phrase, notice the quotes) from around the web:

<div id='mention-it' title="'open source'"/>

Another example: Adding the following tag will cause "Mention-it" to search for
mentions (i.e. links to) a given URL/URI (in this case http://bibapp.org):

<div id='mention-it' title="http://bibapp.org"/>

Yet another example: This time, we want to search for *both* a URL and a specific
Twitter Hashtag.  In this case, mention-it does an "OR" search to find either
the URL or the hashtag.  NOTE: this will also return mentions of just "bibapp"
from blogs, as Google Blog search ignores the "#" (hash) character in searches.

<div id='mention-it' title="http://bibapp.org; #bibapp"/>

A final example: You can also leave off the "http" to perform a search for
all mentions of a particular site.  For example, the below search would
find mentions of "bibapp.org", "www.bibapp.org", "#bibapp", etc.

<div id='mention-it' title="bibapp.org; #bibapp" />

That's all there is to it!  If you like "mention-it", be sure to mention it out
on the web.  If you are on Twitter, tweet either "mention-it.googlecode.com"
or "#MentionIt" to see your mentions appear on the live demo:
http://mention-it.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/example.html

Also, let me know what you think!
